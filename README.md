## Content Description

### Enter your destination
The user can enter a city name to which he wants to travel and a departure date. When he hits the "Submit" button a destination card is generated for this city name.

### Destination card
The destination card contains different elements:
- __Picture__: A picture of the entered city. If no image is found for the city, an image of the destination country is displayed.
- __Summary__: A short summary displays the user's entry and the destination country.
- __Buttons__: The buttons "save trip" and "remove trip" are without functionality
- __Days left until departure__: The destination card tells the user how many days are left until the departure.
- __Temperature__: If the departure is during the next 15 days, a temperature for the destination is displayed.

### For the Reviewer (Extend Option)
I chose to display a picture of the destination's country when Pixabay brings up no result for the destination city.
